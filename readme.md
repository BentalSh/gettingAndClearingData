Well you don't need to, really.

This is my solution to the getting and clearing data exercise on course era.

simply use source("run_analysis.R") to run the script.

Note that the file is a script and doesn't contain a function, and therefore it will just run itself.

Also note that for the script to work, you need to:
  *  Be in a working directory containing the train and test directories.
  *  Have dplyr package installed
